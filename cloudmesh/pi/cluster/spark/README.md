# Setting up a Pi Spark Cluster

We assume you have installed cloudmesh as discussed in the

* [Pi Cloudmesh Instalation Guide](/README.md#installation)


TODO: This is not yet working and under development

The list of spark related commands are:

```
cms pi spark setup --master=MASTER --workers=WORKERS
cms pi spark start --master=MASTER --workers=WORKERS
cms pi spark stop --master=MASTER --workers=WORKERS
cms pi spark test --master=MASTER --workers=WORKERS
cms pi script list spark [--details]
```

## Usage

Let us assume we like to create a cluster with 3 workers and a master.
let us chose the work *red* as the prefix to the hostnames. Let us assume you burned them with cm burner and the hostnames are
*red*, *red01*, *red02*, *red03*.


Then the cluster can be set upi with

```
cms pi spark setup --master=red --workers="red[01-03]"
```

To make sure the setup succeeded, use the command

```
cms pi spark test --master=red"
```

To start the cluster use

```
cms pi spark start --master=red"
```

To stop the cluster you can use

```
cms pi spark stop --master=red"
```


## Script details

Cloudmesh pi contains a convenient mechanism to start scripts remotely
on a number of PI's in parallel.

The script names for the spark deploymnets can  be retrieved with

```
cms pi script list spark
```

To see the details of the script, pleas use

```
cms pi script list spark --details
```


# Appendix details

## Pi Spark setup with shell programs as precursor to above

Website with information <https://www.educba.com/how-to-install-spark/>


 ## Prerequisites for Spark
 
 In order to use cloudmesh-spark, we first set up the Pi master. This
  includes installing Java, Scala and Spark and adding variables to /.bashrc
   so they are available via the terminal
   
 See the shell script files in the directory
  cloudmesh-pi-cluster/cluster/spark/bin/

## Setup using shell scripts
 
 To use the shell program approach:
 1) Create ~/spark-bashrc.txt
 2) Create /bin/spark-setup.sh
 3) Create /bin/spark-copy-spark-to-worker.sh
 4) Create /bin/spark-setup-worker.sh
 5) Create /bin/spark-run-cluster-test.sh
 6) Create /bin/spark-uninstall2.4.5.sh
 

### On Master (green) ran the following:

```bash
sh /bin/spark-setup.sh
```

 ### Setup the Worker (green003)
 **Following are actual steps used in setting up worker green003**

    sh /bin/spark-copy-spark-to-worker.sh  

Which included this detail:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    scp /bin/spark-setup-worker.sh pi@green003:
    scp ~/spark-bashrc.txt pi@green003:
    scp /bin/spark-uninstall2.4.5.sh pi@green003:
    scp ~/sparkout.tgz pi@green003:
    ssh pi@green003 sh ~/spark-setup-worker.sh
    sudo cat >> $SPARK_HOME/conf/slaves << EOF
    pi@green003
    EOF

Received this error:

    7: /bin/spark-scp-setup-to-worker.sh: cannot create /home/pi/spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7/conf/slaves: Permission denied
 
 So made the change to slaves file on master manually
 
  
 ## Test the Master & Worker setup with a Spark test
 
 Spark test run
